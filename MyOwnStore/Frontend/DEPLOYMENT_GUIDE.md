## ✅ Issue Fixed: MIME Type Error

The "Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script but the server responded with a MIME type of 'text/html'" error has been resolved with the following fixes:

### 🔧 What We Fixed:

1. **Updated `vercel.json`**: Added proper routing rules to handle static assets correctly
2. **Enhanced `vite.config.js`**: Improved build configuration with manual chunking
3. **Fixed CSS imports**: Moved `@import` statements before Tailwind directives
4. **Removed deprecated plugins**: Updated Tailwind config for v3.3+ compatibility
5. **Added deployment optimization**: Created proper ignore files and headers

### 📋 Deployment Steps:

#### For Vercel:
```bash
# 1. Clean and build
npm run build

# 2. Deploy to Vercel (if using Vercel CLI)
vercel --prod

# Or push to GitHub and let Vercel auto-deploy
```

#### For Other Platforms:
```bash
# 1. Build the project
npm run build

# 2. The dist/ folder contains your production files
# Upload the contents of dist/ to your hosting provider
```

### 🔍 Troubleshooting:

If you still encounter MIME type errors:

1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) or clear cache
2. **Wait for CDN**: Allow 5-10 minutes for CDN propagation
3. **Check Build Output**: Ensure `dist/assets/` contains .js and .css files
4. **Verify Hosting Config**: Make sure your host serves .js files with `application/javascript` MIME type

### 📊 Build Output Analysis:

Your app is now split into optimized chunks:
- **react.js** (11.83 kB): React core libraries
- **router.js** (34.84 kB): React Router
- **ui.js** (24.82 kB): Lucide React icons
- **utils.js** (60.21 kB): Axios and utility libraries
- **index.js** (542.51 kB): Your main application code
- **index.css** (70.38 kB): All styles including Tailwind

### 🧪 Testing Your Deployment:

```bash
# Test locally before deploying
npm run preview

# Open http://localhost:4173 to test the production build
```

### 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions:

1. **404 on page refresh**: Fixed with our Vercel routing rules
2. **Static assets not loading**: Fixed with proper asset handling
3. **CSS not applying**: Fixed with import order correction
4. **Bundle too large**: Addressed with code splitting

### 🎯 Performance Optimizations Applied:

- ✅ Code splitting by vendor libraries
- ✅ Asset optimization and caching headers
- ✅ Tailwind CSS purging (automatic)
- ✅ Modern JavaScript modules
- ✅ Gzip compression ready
