## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Enhanced OrdersPage.jsx:

// Enhanced cancel handler
const handleCancelOrder = async (orderId, orderNumber) => {
  // ... cancellation logic ...
  if (response.data.success) {
    // Show beautiful modal instead of toast
    setCancelledOrder({...orderToCancel, status: 'cancelled'})
    setShowCancellationModal(true)
  }
}

// Modal handlers
const handleCloseModal = () => {
  setShowCancellationModal(false)
  setCancelledOrder(null)
}

const handleContinueShopping = () => {
  handleCloseModal()
  navigate('/products')
}
```
